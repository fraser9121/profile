        <h2>My Experience</h2>
        <p>As far as professional experience goes, I don't have any. My interest in web design and programming started in my early teens when I began to play around with an open source code for a text based RPG game. I began to pick up the basics of HTML, PHP/MYSQL (A lot of copy and adapt!!!) and also Adobe Photoshop, I ended up with a text based RPG with around 300 regular players.</p>
        <p>I stopped learning once I left school and started work but always had an interest, I've built a few websites for personal use, always using templates. Working as a web designer/programmer has always been a dream and thought I would never get the chance to work in that sector ( I always thought I needed to go to university ect) until now. I hope to develop the skills to get a job doing what I love!</p>
